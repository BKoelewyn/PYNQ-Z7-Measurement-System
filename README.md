# PYNQ Z7 Precision Measurement System

A computer vision system that measures objects with sub-millimeter accuracy using FPGA acceleration.

## What This Does
- Takes pictures of objects with a USB camera
- Measures distances, diameters and areas
- Uses coins or other objects for size reference
- Provides real-time measurements with high accuracy

## Hardware Needed
- PYNQ Z7-20 board
- USB camera (720p or better)
- Reference objects (quarters, pennies)
- Basic lighting

## Project Status
- Week 1: Setting up foundation ‚Üê We are here
- Week 2: FPGA hardware development
- Week 3: Connecting hardware and software
- Week 4: Measurement system
- Week 5: Final testing and optimization

## Quick Start
1. Install Python packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Run the application: `python software/python/main_app.py`
